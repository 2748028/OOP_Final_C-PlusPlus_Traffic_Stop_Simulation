# OOPFinal
# This projects purpose was to simulate a four-way traffic stop with light controls. This four way would be interacted with by conventional smaller vehicles and larger trucks that would have to avoid collissions aswell as obey the traffic rules. 
# This would be visually reported using a GUI to confirm its functionality.
# This was a group project, not all code within was created nor debugged by myself.
